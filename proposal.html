    <h1>Proposal of Shiyu Zhang's Term Project - Shiyu's Kitchen</h1>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>This website will be the online menu and order page of my homemade cuisine-Shiyu's Kitchen.
        In this website, I will post the introduction of my homemade cuisine menu, which has several
        categories of food, and the corresponding photo. Also I will make a online order page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>This page is the access for my customer to order food directly from me 
    rather than from other platform. What's more, people could read the specified
    ingredients and calories for each cuisine. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>
    <p>People who would like to eat some homemade cuisine by me</p>
    <br>
